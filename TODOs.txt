1. Finish documentation
2. Test things (try to break the UI -- try pressing buttons when you shouldn't, etc.)
3. Rename model/view/controller/subject/observer files to use capitals (should rename in #includes as well)
4. Create bonus.txt (we added legal plays indicator when you press the hint button)
5. Submit a zip of the DIRECTORY (not the individual files) to Marmoset
